• "The Philosophy of Cybersecurity and Propaganda" by Lukasz Olejnik

"Cyberspace is not a "grey zone" without rules. This book logically explains what cyberwar is, whether it threatens us, and under what circumstances cyberattacks could lead to war. The chapter on cyberwar is relevant because of the war in Ukraine. The problem of cyberwar in the war in Ukraine is analytically and expertly explained. The rank and importance of these activities are explained, also against the background of broader military activities."
