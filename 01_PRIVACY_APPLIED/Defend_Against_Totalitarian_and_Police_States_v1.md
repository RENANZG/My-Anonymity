  <h2>Defend Against Totalitarian and Police States</h2>

  <h3>General Strategies for Protection from Totalitarian and Police States</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Maintain a Low Profile:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid drawing attention to yourself or your activities.</li>
    <li>Do not openly criticize the government or its officials.</li>
    <li>Dress and behave in ways that do not attract undue attention.</li>
    <li>Avoid Bragging: donâ€™t boast about your activities, connections, or
      capabilities, as this can draw unwanted attention.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Stay Informed:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Listen to news from foreign radio stations (the modern news or podcasts)
      or other underground sources to stay informed about political developments
      and potential threats.
    </li>
    <li>Share information discreetly with trusted friends and family.</li>
    <li>Stay Informed about Surveillance Practices: educate yourself about
      common surveillance techniques used by law enforcement and intelligence
      agencies, so you can take appropriate precautions to protect your
      privacy.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Build Trusted Networks:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Develop and maintain a close-knit group of trusted friends and family.
    </li>
    <li>Form or join underground resistance groups if necessary.</li>
    <li>Exercise Caution with Trust: be wary of trusting anyone, and never
      allow yourself to be blackmailed.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Utilize Community Support:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Engage in mutual aid with trusted community members.</li>
    <li>Support and be supported by others facing similar threats.</li>
    <li>Avoid nosy neighbors.</li>

  </ul>
  <li>Create and Use Safe Spaces:</li>

    <li>Establish safe meeting places where you can discuss sensitive matters.

    <li>Write letters using invisible ink or steganography (the modern cryptography).</li>
    <li>Use face-to-face communication in secluded areas to avoid interception (the modern E2EE).</li>
    <li>Be Mindful of Metadata: understand that even seemingly harmless metadata
      (e.g., location data, timestamps) can be used to track your activities,
      so be cautious about what information you share and how it can be
      interpreted.</li>
    <li>Maintain OpSec: operational Security is crucial; don't reveal your
      plans, strategies, or tactics.</li>

      surveillance and privacy (e.g. search warrant rules), so you can assert
      them if necessary.</li>
    <li>Seek Specialized Advice if Needed: if you believe you are being unfairly
      targeted or monitored, seek legal advice from a qualified attorney
      who specializes in privacy and surveillance issues. Report suspicious
