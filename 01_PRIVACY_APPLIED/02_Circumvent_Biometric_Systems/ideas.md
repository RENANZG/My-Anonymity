### City

It would be fun to create a publicly shared monitoring center for politicians, put cameras on their doorsteps and track them throughout the city.

We see thousands of cameras in the city. Could we occupy it with Lora/Mesh/Freifunk/Guifi.net devices or with our own cameras? The use of solar energy would be even more decentralized in this project. It would be a way of doing away with Room 641A, the problem is that they still have the key

### Drones

How difficult would it be to train an autonomous drone to destroy cameras?

Why destroy thousands of cameras in the city if it's easier to destroy the monitoring center?
